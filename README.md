# Programming-challenges

This repository is used to collect some of the programming challenges I have done in the past.
The code in this repository is not meant for distribution!

### Advent of Code challenges
The coding challenges in the folder "Advent of Code" are from the website https://adventofcode.com/ and every challenge was created by the Advent of Code Team.
The solutions are my own solutions but may have been inspired by some of the solutions available in the git hub repository connected to the challenges e.g. https://github.com/fabrol/aoc2023/

### LeetCode challenges
The LeetCode challenges are from the website https://leetcode.com/problemset/ and again, the challenges were not designed by me but by the LeetCode Team.
The solutions are my own, unless otherwise indicated.
